# Configuration Files

You have to have a mercurial tool. In addition to that you would have to have `hg-git` package installed in the python used by mercurial.

By default Mercurial does not allow Git subrepositories, so you would have to override that setting when you clone this repository:

    hg --config subrepos.git:allowed=true clone https://bitbucket.org/evgeniysharapov/dotfiles .dotfiles

Then you can just cd to `~/.dotfiles` and run `./deploy.sh`. This will create links to the dotfiles in your `$HOME` directory.


## Configuration On Macbook 

Switching Capslock to Ctrl could be done using Karabiner or `hdiutil`. 

Here's what I use to map Capslock to LCtrl and ROption to F18 (later used as a Hyper in Hammerspoon).

        ]}</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

I placed that file into `$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.KeyRemapping.plist`.
